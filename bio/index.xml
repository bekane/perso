            Born in Cameroon, I began my university studies in my home country before advancing my career in France. After completing my degree, I was selected as a research engineer at the Institute of Research in Computer Science of Toulouse (IRIT). This opportunity allowed me to delve into the exciting world of computer science research.
Subsequently, I joined the service company Davidson in Toulouse as a solutions architect. During my four years at Davidson, I had the opportunity to work on various projects within five different companies.
